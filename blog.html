					<h2>Grids and the Web</h2>
					<p class="date">1/10/15</p>
				</header>
				<p>Having been a child on the cusp of the technology age, I was introduced to some technology while I was young, but not much. Art, instead, inspired my childhood. I wanted to draw everything, paint anything and learn every medium that existed. Before college, I delved into ceramics, sculpting, modeling and more. During my undergraduate years, I explored jewelry making, printmaking, lithography, textiles, several years of ceramics, stained glass, photography and even glass blowing. With each medium, my love for art grew. I wanted to major in art, but alas, practicality was knocking at my door. I recalled my father's voice stating, "You can't make a living off selling paintings, Kate." But I wanted to; I had to, so I researched. In the meantime, I took practical courses in Chemistry, Physics, Calculus and Biology.</p>

				<p>In my research, I came upon Graphic Design. This seemed like the perfect mixture of my scientific side and my artistic side that also allowed me to be able to make a living. I fell in love. I took every design course that was offered and ate them up. The programs, the meshing of type and image, the layouts, all intrigued me, but most of all, the grids grids grids! When I was in school, the grid was like the Holy Grail. It defined all things graphic design and layout. There were entire semester-long courses dedicated to it. It carried over into every area of print.</p>

				<p>When I was finishing school, the web was just starting to become something for which people were designing actual websites. My schooling for web design and print was self taught for a while and then many classes ensued in order to stay abreast of ever changing technologies and techniques. It has morphed from designing with nested tables and limited fonts to customizing the fonts and using HTML5 tags in lieu of divs. Throughout this metamorphisis, though, we are moving closer and closer to the infamous grid. I miss it. I love it. I am glad it is finally making a comback. The flex styling and the responsive designs are already applying print design techniques to the web. The upcoming grid will do even more to enhance the aesthetic experience of browsing the web. I, personally, am looking forward to the next step. People that don't understand the intricacies of putting together a print layout are confused when we designers look at websites and cringe. It is just another 2-D media, but due to its nature, it started completely void of design. The web today has finally transformed from no design whatsoever to a completely organized and aesthetically pleasing graphic structure. The grid implementation will further it even more. The designers of the world can't wait.</p>
