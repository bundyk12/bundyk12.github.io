				<h2>Where I've Been</h2>
				<p>I've had some pretty amazing volunteering experiences, from mentoring underpriveledged children to building houses after Hurricane Katrina to serving Christmas dinners to the homeless here in Denver. Giving back to my community is an activity in which I participate on a regular basis. I believe that experiences are the foundation for creativity.</p>

				<h2>What I Can Do</h2>
				<p>Everyone has a different array of talents. My strengths lie in my anal retentiveness. I want every design, every layout, every printed piece to be exactly right. Not good enough or pretty darn close, but exactly right. I am one of the uncommon artists that also aced Chemistry, Calculus and Physics. I like things in order. My designs convey this. Even the edgy work is organized chaos. Clean aesthetics and a crisp feel are common amidst my work.</p>

				<h2>What Inspires Me</h2>
				<p>Outside what I do for a living, which inspires me every day, I keep myself busy with a wild array of activities when I am not in front of a computer. From women's sand doubles to coed grass fours to women's hardcourt sixes, I play a lot of volleyball. It gave me my drive in college and it is still a passion of mine. I also am a knuckledragger on the peaks. I am partial to Breckenridge and even taught there for a few years. I play the piano; I can't read a lick of music, though, despite over a decade of lessons, but I can bang out just about anything by ear. And my Rottweiller and I love the outdoors. We hike parks and glaciers and love discovering hidden microbreweries afterwards.</p>
